// ros2_control SystemInterface for the I2RT YAM arm. Backed by i2rt_can_driver
// (a plain SocketCAN port of i2rt/motor_drivers/{can_interface.py,dm_driver.py}),
// with no internal control-loop thread of its own — controller_manager's own
// update loop drives read()/write() at whatever rate the URDF's <hardware>
// rw_rate specifies, so read()/write() just do blocking CAN I/O synchronously.
//
// Per joint, exposes standard position/velocity/effort command and state
// interfaces, plus kp/kd command interfaces (see <ros2_control> in
// yam_macro.xacro). The DM motors' MIT-mode kp/kd impedance gains default to
// each joint's "kp"/"kd" URDF parameters (ramped from 0 on activation, as
// before) but can be overridden per-cycle by any controller that claims the
// kp/kd command interfaces — e.g. a compliant/gravity-comp controller wanting
// near-zero stiffness. A controller that never touches kp/kd (like
// joint_trajectory_controller) sees no behavior change: those interfaces read
// back NaN until claimed, and the isfinite guard below falls back to the URDF
// default exactly as it always has.
//
// Gravity compensation: a per-joint feed-forward torque, computed once per
// write() cycle from a KDL chain (parsed from the /robot_description topic
// this class subscribes to internally) via KDL::ChainDynParam::JntToGravity,
// scaled by each joint's "gravity_comp_factor" URDF param and clamped to
// +/-max_gravity_torque_nm. Added on top of whatever the effort command
// interface requests (0 if unclaimed) — mirroring MotorChainRobot.update()'s
// `motor_torques = joint_commands.torques + g * gravity_comp_factor` in the
// Python reference, which is active in every control mode, not just an idle
// mode. gravity_comp_factor_ is also live-tunable per joint (not just a
// startup-only URDF read) via a "gravity_comp_factor.<joint_name>" parameter
// on diagnostics_node_ (see on_init()) — that node takes its namespace from
// whatever the enclosing controller_manager PROCESS was actually launched
// under (deliberately NOT an explicit override - see on_init()'s comment
// there for why that matters), so its fully-qualified name is
// "/<info.name>_diagnostics" for a non-namespaced launch (e.g.
// "/yam_system_diagnostics" for this repo's single-arm launches, prefix=""),
// or "/<namespace>/<info.name>_diagnostics" under a namespaced one (e.g.
// "/leader/yam_system_diagnostics" for i2rt_teleop's leader_follower.launch.py's
// leader). e.g. `ros2 param set /yam_system_diagnostics
// gravity_comp_factor.joint3 0.5` (single-arm) takes effect on the very next
// write() cycle, no relaunch needed. Added
// specifically to make empirical re-tuning practical; the URDF <param> is
// still what a fresh activation starts from, so update that too once a
// value is validated, or it reverts on next relaunch. Like kp/kd (see
// Safety below), this is ramped from 0 on activation rather than applied at
// full strength instantly — see that paragraph for
// why.
//
// Per-motor diagnostics (temperature, error code) that don't fit
// sensor_msgs/JointState are published directly on an internal rclcpp::Node
// as i2rt_msgs/MotorStatus, throttled to ~10 Hz — a pragmatic choice over a
// dedicated broadcaster-controller plugin. The same internal node is reused
// to subscribe to /robot_description for the gravity model.
//
// Safety: kp/kd AND gravity_torques (see above) are all ramped linearly from
// 0 up to their target value over gain_ramp_seconds_ (default 1.5s) starting
// from every on_activate(), rather than commanding full gain/torque
// instantly. kp/kd ramping bounds how hard the arm can snap toward its hold
// command if the very first position reading after enable is ever wrong (bad
// config, transient CAN glitch, etc.) — added after a big_yam unit briefly
// moved at high speed on activation when it was mistakenly brought up with
// the standard yam's motor/gain config. Gravity torque was originally
// exempted from this ramp (applied at full strength from the first cycle,
// reasoned to be safe since it's the arm's own weight, not an arbitrary
// command) but that turned out to be its own hazard: since kd is still
// ramping in over the same window, there's very little damping available to
// arrest the arm if gravity_comp_factor/the URDF's inertial model is even
// moderately wrong for the real arm — confirmed directly (2026-09-22): a yam
// unit visibly jumped to an unexpected pose and held there on every
// activation in compliant_mode, before gravity ramping was added. Ramping
// gravity torque in lockstep with kd fixes this regardless of how accurate
// the model ends up being, at the cost of a brief (< gain_ramp_seconds_)
// under-supported window right after activation where the arm isn't fully
// held against its own weight yet - same accepted tradeoff kp/kd's ramp
// already makes for position-holding.
//
// compliant_mode (hardware param, default false): mirrors
// MotorChainRobot's zero_gravity_mode (i2rt/robots/motor_chain_robot.py,
// the Python reference this class is ported from), which is the default
// there too. Confirmed directly in its __init__: when zero_gravity_mode,
// `self._commands = JointCommands.init_all_zero(...)` (kp=0, kd=0) and then
// `self._commands.kd = self._grav_comp_kd.copy()` — i.e. kp is exactly
// zero, always, and kd comes from a separate, dedicated, already hardware-
// tuned per-joint array (`grav_comp_kd` in i2rt/robots/config/big_yam.yml:
// [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1] for this arm's 6 joints) rather than any
// fraction of the position-control kd. There is no kp-based "gentle
// anti-drift spring" in the reference at all — holding position comes
// entirely from the gravity feed-forward (compute_gravity_torques() below)
// being accurate; kd here is only for damping/stability, never for holding.
// An earlier version of this class invented a fractional-kp mechanism that
// doesn't exist in the reference — removed once actually checking the
// source showed it wasn't how the real robot does this.
//
// So: while compliant, every joint's kp *fallback* (used whenever nothing
// has claimed that joint's kp command interface — see write()'s NaN guard
// above) is exactly 0.0, unconditionally, and kd's fallback is that joint's
// compliant_kd_ (URDF "compliant_kd" <param>, meant to be set to the ported
// grav_comp_kd value for that joint). Since gravity compensation is
// unconditional either way, kp=0 makes it the only torque holding the arm
// up against gravity — a hand-backdrivable default, still ramped in the
// same as any other kp/kd target. Intended for a teleoperation leader arm
// meant to be hand-guided rather than commanded — see
// big_yam_ros2_control.xacro's macro comment. An explicit kp/kd command
// from a real controller always overrides this fallback, in either mode.
//
// If the arm still sags/falls with this correctly configured, the problem
// is upstream of kp/kd entirely: either compute_gravity_torques()'s
// max_gravity_torque_nm_ clamp is truncating a real torque need (the Python
// reference's own clip_motor_torque defaults to unclamped, unlike this
// class's 25 Nm default — check the logs for "Gravity torque for joint...
// clamped" warnings), or gravity_comp_factor_/the URDF's inertial model
// doesn't match this arm's real mass distribution closely enough. No kp/kd
// value can be both "compliant" and "strong enough to hold against a large
// feed-forward deficit" at the same time — those two goals only stop
// conflicting once the feed-forward itself is right.
//
// A joint with requires_calibration=true (the linear_4310 gripper: it has no
// absolute encoder, so software doesn't know where its hard stops are after
// a power cycle) gets its hard-stop limits probed automatically, every
// on_activate(), before the gain ramp starts — see GripperCalibration and
// run_gripper_calibrations() below. This drives that motor into both hard
// stops with a small constant torque for up to a few seconds; keep the
// gripper clear of obstructions/fingers before activating real hardware.
