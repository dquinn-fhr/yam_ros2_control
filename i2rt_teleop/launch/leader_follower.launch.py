"""Leader-follower bringup for two YAM arms: one ros2_control stack per arm
under its own namespace ('leader'/'follower'; each still uses unprefixed
joint1..joint6 internally, disambiguated only by namespace - see
leader_follower_node.cpp's class comment for why no cross-arm zero-alignment
is assumed or checked automatically) plus the mirroring node itself.

The leader arm is hand-backdrivable by default (compliant_mode - see
big_yam_ros2_control.xacro's macro comment, which quotes and matches
MotorChainRobot's zero_gravity_mode exactly): every joint's kp falls back
to exactly 0.0 (gravity comp alone holds the arm up) and kd falls back to
that joint's own "compliant_kd" param (the ported, already hardware-tuned
grav_comp_kd value, not a guess), and no position controller is spawned at
all, since it's meant to be hand-guided and only read from, never
commanded. The follower keeps its normal stiff position-hold behavior and
full controller set, since it's the one being driven.

Defaults to mock hardware on both sides for safe, no-CAN-needed testing
(mock hardware has no impedance/MIT control model, so compliant_mode has no
real effect there - the follower's own position tracking is still visible,
just not the leader's backdrivability):

    ros2 launch i2rt_teleop leader_follower.launch.py

Real hardware (only after independently confirming both arms hold position
cleanly with plain ros2_control first, no teleop node involved, AND manually
verifying leader/follower joint-zero alignment - see leader_follower_node.cpp):

    ros2 launch i2rt_teleop leader_follower.launch.py use_mock_hardware:=false \\
        leader_can_channel:=can0 follower_can_channel:=can1 alignment_confirmed:=true

Both arms default to having the linear_4310 gripper installed. If neither arm
has a gripper physically attached, pass use_gripper:=false - this drops the
gripper links/joint from both arms' URDFs, skips spawning the follower's
gripper_controller, and disables the leader-follower node's gripper mirroring:

    ros2 launch i2rt_teleop leader_follower.launch.py use_gripper:=false
